This repository stores the scripts meant to maintain the Austin Equity Analysis Zones (EAZs). The EAZs were originally created by work led by the City of Austin's Transportation Department [Systems Development Division](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/transportation-systems-development) and [Open Austin](https://www.open-austin.org/). 

More coming soon...
